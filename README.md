## 🎯 Core Question

> *What limits intelligent behavior in physical systems **before learning even begins**?*

This repository investigates the **fundamental constraints** of physics simulation — numerical stability, performance bottlenecks, and hardware limitations — that shape what's possible in robotics and embodied AI.

## 🔬 Motivation

Modern robotics and reinforcement learning depend on **high-fidelity, high-throughput simulation**:

- **Training RL agents** — millions of environment steps required
- **Policy validation** — verify control strategies before real-world deployment  
- **Sim-to-real transfer** — bridge the gap between virtual and physical systems

Yet simulation itself operates under **hard constraints**:

| Constraint | Trade-off |
|:-----------|:----------|
| **Accuracy** | Higher precision → slower computation |
| **Stability** | Smaller timesteps → more steps required |
| **Throughput** | Parallelization → synchronization overhead |

**You cannot optimize all three simultaneously.** This repository makes these trade-offs explicit through **first-principles experiments**.

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

Every experiment follows these principles:

**1. Bottom-Up Implementation** — Start from discrete physics loops, not abstracted frameworks  
**2. Systems-Level Metrics** — Measure latency, memory bandwidth, numerical drift, scaling behavior  
**3. Isolated Variables** — Study one concept at a time with no entangled effects  
**4. Reproducible & Interpretable** — Clear experimental setup, visualizations, and documented insights  
**5. Interview-Ready Depth** — Each module answers real systems questions for production robotics/RL
